# hello-world
first step to learn something new
I want to join the programming community. This is the future
that gives new possibilities and even changes life.
I started my adventure with computers in 1995 and the experience taught me how it works and how to configure  PC. In the early years, I tried to reprogram the BIOS chip and installed BeOS intuitively. I started to break the   mobile phones simlocks and connect via Bluetooth to a mobile phone of my neighbour using simple programs. But it is still doesn't satisfy me, and I want to use heavy programming language. My dream is to work in a green place as an independent freelancer, away from my hometown, with my wife and children. I have no experience in that but If you can do it, so why shouldn't I try with that?
